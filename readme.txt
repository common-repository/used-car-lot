== Description ==
Creates a used car dealership with the following additional items:<br> 
Wordpress Theme [TwentyTen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyten/)<br> 
My child theme [Used-car-Lot-Theme](https://github.com/jhcorsair/Used-Car-Lot-Theme)<br>
Install a header image slider of your choice. The one I'm using in the demo is the<br> 
WonderPlugin Slider. 
The [Wp-mail-smtp plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/),<br>
And [The Github Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater)<br>
Which handles updates for the theme. Many thanks to Andy Fragen. 

Administration menus are automatically published on the front-end when the admin logs in and then unpublished when 
logging out. What makes this happen are *the page titles*, so please *do not change them*. 

Enabling the wp-mail-smtp Plugin allows your potential customers to email you with questions using your
email server with just a few clicks. Users must be registered and their user profile (Firstname / Lastname) filled out to use this option. 
The members-only of your site also have access to view the text description and detail photos of the car.
